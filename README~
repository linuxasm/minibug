minibug is a simple menu style debugger for assembler code. It runs in
a Linux terminal. It reads ELF executables and will show
symbols if present.

QUICK START
 1. minibug is contained in a single file and can be copied to
    a "bin" directory or used locally with "./minibug"
 2. start debugging with:  minibug <executable>

To create an assembler file with symbols use:
 nasm -felf32 -g your_file.asm
 ld -melf_i386 -o your_file.o
