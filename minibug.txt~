DESCRIPTION

minibug is a simple console or terminal debugger.
It provides a main window with rgister display, breakpoint
display, a code display, and memory display.

Two keys cycle through window:
  w - select next window
  W - selects mini window when in debug window

Initially the debug (main window) is displayed with
a small mini window on the right side. The mini window
can be toggled between several modes by pressing shift
w (upper case w).

The debug window can be replaced with several other windows
by pressing the w key. Each press will show a different window.
Also windows can be selected by pressing alt key and first
letter of their name.

MiniBug starts in debug window, recognizing the following keys:
 ?-window help                f-find label, or register name
 w-toggle to next win         <enter>-find next
 W-toggle mini win on right   alt-letter -select window by letter 
 s-step                       up-scroll up
 o-step over                  down-scroll down 
 g-go                         pgup-page up 
 q-quit                       pgdn-page down 
 h-help

Register window recognizes the following keys:
 ?-window help               alt-letter -select window by letter
