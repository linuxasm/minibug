Asmlib is a library of Linux functions for X86
processors.  All code was written in assembler.
In general, functions do not preserve registers
or check for errors.  The CLD flag is assumed
to be set.  Also, some functions assume other
functions are called first.  For example, the
functions mouse_enable, read_window_size are
setup functions usually called at beginning of
programs.
